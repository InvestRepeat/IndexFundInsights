# IndexFundInsights
[IndexFundInsights.com](https://indexfundinsights.com/) ranks Index Funds as per Total Fees, where Total Fees is Expense Ratio &amp; Tracking Error.
## Criteria for Fund Selection:
- Must be tracking BSE or NSE Indices.
- A fund category is only considered if atleast 1 fund of that category has AUM above ₹500 Crore.
- Must be a "Direct" plan. Regular plans cost higher.
- Fund of Funds (FoF) not considered as tracking error & expense ratio are reported lower than actual. FoFs report their own expense ratio & tracking error but dosen't report the Expense Ratio & Tracking Error of underlying fund; which has to be incurred by the investor.
- Among all the funds of a particular index, only top 3 funds depending on its 'Total Fees' & AUM for each Index will be visible.

Nifty 50 will be the only index that will display Top 5 funds instead of Top 3 due to highest AUM being allocated in this index.

There are indices like Nifty200 Momentum 30 where only 1 fund from that category crosses the ₹500Cr AUM. So for showing Top 3 funds for those categories, the next 2 funds as per highest AUM will be tracked and used for Top 3 ranking. The other 2 funds will have (AUM<500Cr) tagged with their name.
